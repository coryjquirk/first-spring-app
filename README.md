# casestudy
NOT ACTUAL CAPSTONE YET - just first Spring project

### NOTE (4/10/22):

As of 3/30, in class I began working off of Eric's `casestudy` repo:

https://github.com/EricH-PerScholas/TEK-Global-Java-Minneapolis/commits/master/casestudy

So this repo is basically nullified and now I can start working on my `Java-CaseStudy` repo again, with this as basic reference for setup.
